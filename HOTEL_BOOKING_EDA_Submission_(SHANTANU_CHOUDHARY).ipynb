By analyzing hotel booking data, we can identify patterns and trends that can help hotels better anticipate cancellations, adjust their pricing strategies, and increase their occupancy rates. Specifically, this project aims to explore the factors that influence cancellations and occupancy rates in order to help hotels make data-driven decisions about their pricing and marketing strategies.

In the context of hotel booking analysis, finding a 15% mismatch in the rooms reserved versus the rooms assigned by the hotels suggests that there may be issues with the hotel's room allocation process or with the booking system.

Improvements to the booking system or room allocation process could help reduce the number of mismatches and improve the overall customer experience."
